- Shuffle and Sort -> Reduce -> Map
- **Map -> Shuffle and Sort -> Reduce**
- Shuffle and Sort -> Map -> Reduce

### 7. What is a benefit of using pre-built Hadoop images?

- Guaranteed hardware support.
- Less software choices to choose from.
- **Quick prototyping, deploying, and validating of projects.**
- Quick prototyping, deploying, and guaranteed bug free.

### 8. What is an example of open-source tools built for Hadoop and what does it do?

- Giraph, for SQL-like queries.
- Pig, for real-time and in-memory processing of big data.
- Zookeeper, analyze social graphs.
- **Giraph, for processing large-scale graphs.**

### 9. What is the difference between low level interfaces and high level interfaces?

- **Low level deals with storage and scheduling while high level deals with interactivity.**
- Low level deals with interactivity while high level deals with storage and scheduling.

### 10. Which of the following are problems to look out for when integrating your project with Hadoop?
