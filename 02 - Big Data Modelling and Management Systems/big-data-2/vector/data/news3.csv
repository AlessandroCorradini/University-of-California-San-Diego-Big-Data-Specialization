12,Boston Globe,3/22/2016,"Clinton, Trump offer contrasting responses to Brussels attacks","Donald Trump called Tuesday for greater reliance on torture and border lock-downs to combat terrorism like that in Brussels, while Hillary Clinton dismissed those measures as ineffective and said “steady, strong, smart hands’’ are needed in the White House. Those sharply divergent statements from the Republican and Democratic front-runners reflect a fundamental contrast in style and policy approaches to national security. The issue is likely to grow more pressing in the wake of the Brussels bombings, which killed at least 30 and injured hundreds. At stake is not only Trump’s proposal to lift the US ban on torture, but how to combat the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the Tuesday attacks, as well as screen immigrants from global hot spots, and conduct domestic spying, surveillance, and data-monitoring. Trump’s demand for a return to torture — “more than waterboarding’’ he said Tuesday — could violate international law and has been condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike. But it produces a gut-level appeal among his supporters, who crave a powerful, retaliatory solution to terrorism. Clinton, meanwhile, is relying on her deep government experience, tenure as secretary of state, and detailed knowledge of security matters to convey a sense of competency and calm in the face of global dangers, while implying that a Trump presidency could be unpredictable and dangerous. She said on CNN that authorities need to deploy more police to protect “soft targets’’ like the Brussels airport against suicide bombers. Clinton, on NBC’s “Today,’’ urged security officials to intensify efforts to find terrorists and prevent attacks, but said they “do not need to resort to torture.” “We have to be absolutely strong and smart and steady in how we respond,” Clinton said. “We’ve got to work this through consistent with our values.” Some political observers last fall predicted that the Paris massacre in November would slow Trump’s momentum by highlighting his lack of foreign policy experience. Instead, Trump maintained his lead in polls as he ramped up his nationalistic rhetoric against immigrants and Muslim refugees following Paris and the subsequent terror attack in San Bernardino, Calif., in December. His remarks about closing US borders, waterboarding Muslim terror suspects, and greater scrutiny of immigrants and refugees have become popular refrains at his rallies that routinely draws thousands of cheering supporters chanting “USA! USA!” On Tuesday, Trump attributed his lead in polls to his discussion of terrorism “much more than anybody else.” “We can’t be soft and weak,” Trump told NBC. “I’d be very, very tough on the borders, and I would be not allowing certain people to come into this country.” Trump said he would bring back waterboarding, a technique considered to be torture that is now banned by a UN convention ratified by the United States. “Frankly, the waterboarding, if it was up to me, and if we changed the laws or had the laws, waterboarding would be fine,’’ Trump said. “If they could expand the laws, I would do a lot more than waterboarding. You have to get the information from these people.” Analysts say it will be difficult for Trump, if he captures the nomination, to attract voters in a general election who are outside the GOP tent. “I don’t think he’s converting anyone with his rhetoric because it is so substance-less,” said Mark Mellman, a Democratic strategist. He said Clinton, on the other hand, “has strong opinions that are well grounded in facts and experience. What Trump offers is just bravado.” Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, said that Clinton responding to Trump’s policies plays into both candidates’ plans. “Hillary Clinton wants to make Donald Trump the issue of this campaign,” Luntz said. “She wants it to be a referendum on Trump. Trump doesn’t mind it being a referendum on him. “He says things that grab attention, that are very controversial. But these are scary times. It allows him to be more dramatic than what a candidate might usually be,” Luntz added. Trump spent Monday in Washington giving Republicans and the media a preview of what a Trump presidency would look like, introducing some of his foreign policy team to Washington Post editorial writers. In his meeting with the Post, Trump questioned the need for the United States’ continued involvement in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an intergovernmental military alliance headquartered in Brussels. Senator Ted Cruz, Trump’s strongest rival for the GOP nomination, slammed Trump for backing away from NATO. Cruz also invoked fear of foreigners in his response to the attacks at the Brussels airport and a subway station near the European Union headquarters. He called for an immediate halt to refugees from countries with a significant Al Qaeda or Islamic State presence and for securing the country’s southern border to prevent terrorists from infiltrating. He advocated for surveillance of Muslim neighborhoods, an idea that echoes Trump’s previous proposals to spy on mosques and make Muslims in America register and carry special identification cards. “We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized,” Cruz said. Governor John Kasich of Ohio, also running for the GOP nomination, said on Fox News Tuesday that Trump’s proposal to close the borders would not be a “wise way to proceed” and unlike his rivals for the presidency, did not blame Islam. He said the United States should lead a coalition of NATO and Arab countries to destroy the Islamic State. Bernie Sanders, who is challenging Clinton for the Democratic nomination, said in a statement that the Brussels attack served as a “brutal reminder that the international community must come together to destroy ISIS.”"
13,The Washington Post,4/6/2016,Donald Trump thinks more countries should have nuclear weapons. Here’s what the research says.,"According to Donald Trump, the United States should not try so hard to stop nuclear proliferation. On Sunday night, during a Republican town hall hosted by CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Trump declared that proliferation is “going to happen anyway.” And just a week earlier, Trump told the New York Times, “If Japan had that nuclear threat, I’m not sure that would be a bad thing for us.” Nor would it be so bad, he’s said, if South Korea and Saudi Arabia had nuclear weapons, too. We can break down Trump’s assertions into two ideas: Proliferation is inevitable, and it is good for the United States — at least when its allies are the ones going nuclear. What can political science tell us about each of these beliefs? It turns out that both propositions fly in the face of a wide range of recent scholarship. Is nuclear proliferation inevitable? Trump’s logic for this idea is based on his belief that the United States is weak and that past proliferation ensures future proliferation. Here’s what Trump told the Times about Japan: “If the United States keeps on … its current path of weakness, [Japan is] going to want to have [nuclear weapons] anyway with or without me discussing it.” Trump also implied that South Korea and Japan would inexorably seek nuclear weapons — regardless of what the United States does — because so many countries have already gone nuclear. As he said to Anderson Cooper: “It’s only a question of time. … You have so many [nuclear] countries already.” But as we show in a number of research articles, those assumptions don’t match the historical record. For the past 70 years, through mutually reinforcing policies — including security guarantees, troop deployments, arms sales, nuclear umbrellas and sanctions threats — U.S. administrations from both parties have inhibited nuclear proliferation. When another country built nuclear weapons, the United States limited the repercussions by discouraging that country from conducting nuclear tests. What about Trump’s belief that U.S. allies will inevitably seek nuclear weapons because the United States is economically and militarily weak? That doesn’t match the facts, either. The United States remains the world’s dominant military power — it spends three to four times as much on its military than China does, and it has the world’s most advanced nuclear arsenal. The United States also has a dynamic and growing economy, while its rivals’ economies are slowing or even declining. But even when the U.S. economy was flagging, the government successfully prevented other countries from acquiring nuclear arms. The 1970s were a period of high inflation and low economic growth in the United States. Yet that’s when Washington launched some of its most determined and successful nonproliferation efforts, including founding the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group, a global body that restricts the spread of sensitive nuclear technology, and passing laws that imposed mandatory nonproliferation sanctions, which have successfully deterred other countries from embarking on nuclear weapons programs. Although history suggests that proliferation is not inevitable, recent research on nonproliferation suggests that Trump’s proposed foreign policy might make it so. Trump says he would scale back or entirely end U.S. alliance commitments unless our allies made major financial concessions. In his interview with the Times, Trump said that the United States “take[s] tremendous monetary hits on protecting countries” such as Japan, South Korea, Germany and Saudi Arabia. He also denounced the U.S.-Japan Mutual Security Treaty as “one-sided,” said that the United States doesn’t need to maintain forces in South Korea and described the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as “obsolete.” But if those security institutions and military deployments disappeared, U.S. allies — including Japan and South Korea — might well pursue nuclear weapons of their own. Recent research shows that alliances are a powerful tool for preventing proliferation, both because they reassure states that their security will be protected in case of attack and because they give senior partners the leverage to restrain their allies’ nuclear ambitions. Research also demonstrates that the type of U.S. troop withdrawals Trump envisions have a history of prompting allies to consider developing their own nuclear weapons. Consider the last time the United States had a president who was skeptical about nonproliferation and who tried to reduce U.S. commitments to its allies in Asia. As part of his Guam Doctrine — a plan to increase Asian allies’ military self-reliance — President Nixon withdrew 20,000 troops from South Korea. Famously, he also traveled to China to improve Sino-American relations. As a result, South Korea launched a covert nuclear weapons program, and Taiwan ramped up its own nuclear ambitions. So why didn’t they end up with nuclear weapons? The administrations that followed Nixon’s redoubled efforts to stop them. Research does not support the idea that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable. But isolationist “America First” policies could prompt that spread. Defining U.S. strategic interests primarily in terms of monetary gain, and curtailing U.S. global engagement toward that end, would boost the probability that our allies would respond by going nuclear. Would nuclear proliferation be good for U.S. interests? What about Trump’s second proposition: that proliferation by our allies would be good for U.S. interests? This argument is based on the idea that nuclear-armed allies could help contain U.S. adversaries and enable the United States to save money. As Trump told Cooper, “I would rather see Japan having some form of defense, and maybe even offense, against North Korea.” And as he suggested, the United States can’t afford to protect Japan and South Korea — and therefore, “they have to pay us or we have to let them protect themselves.” Reducing military commitments and letting allies build their own nuclear weapons might save money for the United States. But international relations scholarship suggests that allied proliferation would have broader negative repercussions. Among these would be declining U.S. influence. When nations gain their own military capabilities, they rely less on their allies and become less subject to their sway. And that can undermine a senior partner’s ability to hold its junior allies back from risky military actions. In other words, allowing or encouraging proliferation would worsen the “American weakness” that Trump decries. Recent nonproliferation research underscores this proposition. Mark Bell shows that nuclear allies are likely to become more independent of their patrons and in some cases can develop more assertive foreign policies. And Francis Gavin and Matthew Kroenig show that the fear of declining influence was one reason why most American administrations vigorously opposed the spread of nuclear weapons. Nuclear allies can also become security risks. Vipin Narang demonstrates that when weaker states gain nuclear weapons, they often seek to coerce their senior partners into intervening on their behalf by threatening to use nuclear weapons. That’s what Israel did at the height of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. That’s what South Africa did during its 1988 confrontation with Cuban forces in Angola. And that’s what Pakistan did in the midst of its 1990 military crisis with India. Instead of relieving the United States of a military burden, as Donald Trump suggests, having more nuclear allies could increase the risk that the United States would get involved in conflicts that might turn nuclear. Furthermore, were South Korea or Japan to begin developing nuclear weapons, their rivals might be tempted to launch preventive military strikes, which research suggests has been frequently considered in the past. The road to nuclear acquisition is often rocky and increases the likelihood of militarized conflict. For example, Soviet worries that West Germany would acquire nuclear weapons helped trigger the Berlin Crisis. And if Japan or South Korea actually acquired nuclear weapons, we could possibly see a nuclear arms race in Asia. Japan’s neighbors, including South Korea, would fear resurgent Japanese militarism. North Korea would expand its nuclear capabilities. China would continue to expand its own nuclear arsenal. Why haven’t we seen nuclear arms races before? Nuclear “domino effects” have not been common historically. But that’s largely because of determined U.S. efforts to stop them. Since the dawn of the nuclear age, the United States has pursued nonproliferation as a top policy priority. That includes sponsoring and enforcing the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Research suggests the NPT has been instrumental in limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, in part by coordinating states’ beliefs about one another’s nonproliferation commitments. To develop nuclear weapons, Japan and South Korea would need to violate or withdraw from the NPT. That could prompt U.S. allies and adversaries in other regions — including Saudi Arabia, Germany and Iran — to question the treaty’s viability and consider seeking their own nuclear arsenals. Would this be so bad? After all, no two nuclear armed states have fought a major war with each other, and nuclear weapons have not been used in conflict since the United States bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. But the conclusion that nuclear weapons produce peace is subject to debate. It’s true that there has been no war between major powers since 1945. But that may be due to other factors. The quantitative evidence linking nuclear weapons to a reduced risk of conflict is limited at best. Further, theoretical and historical evidence suggests that nuclear accidents and miscalculations are likely. More countries with nuclear weapons would mean more opportunities for catastrophic nuclear mistakes. A look at history shows us that nuclear proliferation is anything but inevitable. U.S. nonproliferation efforts have been surprisingly successful, even when the United States was weaker than it is today. Without firm U.S. opposition to the spread of nuclear weapons — a policy implemented through “carrots” like alliances and “sticks” like sanctions — the world would probably have far more than nine countries with nuclear weapons. What’s more, research suggests that nuclear proliferation would reduce U.S. world influence, undermine global stability and increase the risk of nuclear war."
14,CNN,3/31/2016,Japan and South Korea hit back at Trump's nuclear comments,"Confused, shocked, bewildered. Just a few of the words used in recent days to describe Japan and South Korea's reaction to some of Donald Trump's latest comments about the region. The front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination stunned two of America's strongest allies with the suggestion that the U.S. military would be withdrawn from their shores, with nuclear weapons replacing them. There are currently 54,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan and 28,500 in South Korea. ""Japan is better if it protects itself against this maniac of North Korea,"" Trump told CNN's Anderson Cooper Tuesday. ""We are better off frankly if South Korea is going to start protecting itself ... they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us."" So high was the level of concern, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe felt the need to respond publicly, saying, ""whoever will become the next president of the United States, the Japan-U.S. alliance is the cornerstone of Japan's diplomacy."" Japan remains the only country to have had nuclear weapons used against it and has had a non-nuclear policy and pacifist constitution since the end of World War II. Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida added, ""It is impossible that Japan will arm itself with nuclear weapons."" South Korea has a small minority who think Trump may have a point and welcome the idea of nuclear weapons.

Academic Cheong Seong-Chang from the non-profit think-tank the Sejong Institute said, ""If we have nuclear weapons, we'll be in a much better position to deal with North Korea."" But his feeling is not mainstream. Government reaction has been more focused on Trump's assertion that South Korea is not paying its way. Trump told CNN's Wolf Blitzer earlier this year, ""South Korea is a money machine but they pay us peanuts ... South Korea should pay us very substantially for protecting them."" Howls of inaccuracy came from the South Korean Foreign Ministry, the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, and even the White House. Ambassador Mark Lippert said Seoul pays for 55% of all non-personnel costs. And former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Christopher Hill was more succinct. He told CNN, ""I don't know what he's talking about but clearly neither does he."" Newspaper editorials and experts alike have taken aim at Trump's comments about introducing more nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula to counter the North Korean threat. Daniel Pinkston of Troy University said it would play into North Korea's hands. ""The hardliners in Pyongyang would just love such an outcome because if that were to occur, it would completely justify their nuclear status ... and validate Kim Jong Un's policy line as absolutely brilliant and absolutely correct,"" he said. Reflecting a growing concern, Pinkston added, ""Whether he wins the Republican nomination or not, or whether he is elected president or not, even at this stage, he is already doing damage to the U.S. reputation internationally. And damaging U.S. security interests.""

15,BBC,4/7/2016,US election: Could Trump really cut the US $19tn debt in eight years?,"Donald Trump's policy proposals have generated a lot of headlines over the course of his presidential campaign. But none has made economists shriek more than the Republican front-runner's suggestion that he could eliminate US government debt in eight years. Official US public debt is over $19tn (£13.4tn) - this accounts for the amount of money the government has borrowed through treasury and saving bonds. Since the US government is borrowing more than it brings in through taxes in order to pay its bills - including the servicing of this debt- it is running on a deficit. Economists argue over this figure, saying the debt level could be much higher, if the government included the money it owes itself for running federal programmes. To eliminate the public debt in eight years, a potential President Trump would need to come up with an extra $2.4tn a year either through spending cuts or tax increases. Trump campaign spokesman Barry Bennett said the debt could be wiped by selling government assets, including government buildings, land and energy resources. He claims this could bring in $16tn. According to the US Government Accountability Office, though, the federal government only owns $3.1tn in assets. This does not include natural resources or stewardship assets. To get close to Mr Bennett's figure, Americans would have to give up all their national parks, and sell the natural resources on public land including timber and minerals. The country would also have to sell energy reserves like offshore oil and hope the price of that oil - which has fallen over 70% since June 2014 - starts rising. Deficit hawks, who have decried politicians for ignoring the country's ever mounting debt burden, rose up to point out that although the US needs to address this problem, Mr Trump's overall economic plan on tax and spending would actually take the country in the opposite direction.

According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget - a cross-party group - Mr Trump's economic plan would double the national debt, with it growing naturally to a $28tn deficit by 2026, plus another $10tn from the spending and tax cuts Mr Trump has proposed. Mr Trump has put forward a tax plan that would charge individuals between 0% and 25% tax based on income and cut the corporate tax rate in half to 15%. He has said this will lead to economic growth as more companies open in the US and individuals spend more money they don't have to give to the taxman. Mr Trump claims his plan will not add to the national deficit because cuts will be offset by closing tax loopholes. But economists predict his tax plan could reduce the money coming into the federal government by between $9.5tn and $12tn. ""With Trump's tax plan there is no way we could get to a balanced budget in eight years,"" says Ron Haskins from Brookings Institute. All economists agree that, to get the US budget balanced, some harsh spending cuts would be required. But according to the CRFB, under Mr Trump's proposed plan, 96% of government spending would need to be eliminated. The outspoken candidate has ruled out any cuts to Social Security - the government pension programme. It accounts for the largest portion of US government spending. He has pledged to reduce the cost of Medicaid - the government sponsored healthcare programme and the US government's second largest expense - by $300bn through reduced prescription drug costs. The US public as a whole, including Medicaid, spent just over that amount - $374bn- on prescription drugs in 2015. For Mr Trump to save that amount of money he would need to reduce Medicaid's drug bill to zero. Mr Trump has also said he would save money by lowering the number of people on Medicaid by creating more jobs. But most recipients of the government healthcare programme are already employed in low-paying jobs. Like many other politicians, Mr Trump has said his administration would cut waste and fraud, saving the US government billions. Most economists agree this is necessary, but waste and fraud make up such a small percentage of the national debt that this alone could never lead to a balanced budget. The real key to Mr Trump's plan seems to be boosting the economy, which he has promised to accomplish by renegotiating trade deals. On his campaign website though, he lists cutting the debt as integral to that negotiation process. ""Closing the deficit and reducing our debt will mean China cannot blackmail us with our own Treasury bond,"" the website says. It's unclear which comes first - cutting the debt to boost the US position in trade negotiations or renegotiating to boost the economy and bring down the debt. According to Mr Haskins, boosting the economy is one way to cut the deficit but ""it would require an unprecedented amount of growth"" - perhaps as high as 20%. That is assuming, too, that Mr Trump's insistence on renegotiating trade deals does not lead to a trade war and a decline in the US economy, as some economists have suggested might happen. All told, it is unlikely that any of the plans Mr Trump has proposed will cut the national debt, according to experts. They would more likely increase it. "
